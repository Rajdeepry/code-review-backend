❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function add(a, b) { return a + b + c; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function attempts to use a variable `c` that is not defined within the
function's scope. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Removed the reference to the undefined variable `c`. If `c` is intended to
be a parameter, it should be included in the function definition. If `c` is
meant to be a global variable, it should be explicitly handled, but using global
variables is generally discouraged.
